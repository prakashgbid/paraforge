## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Before creating an issue, ensure:

- [ ] **Clear scope** - Can you explain it in one sentence?
- [ ] **Right level** - Feature vs Epic vs Story vs Task?
- [ ] **Proper labels** - At least: Scope, Domain, Type, Priority
- [ ] **Clear ownership** - Team label assigned?
- [ ] **Dependencies identified** - Blocks or blocked by?
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** - How will we know it's done?
- [ ] **Estimated effort** - Scope label matches estimate?
- [ ] **Business value** - Why are we doing this?

## üéØ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Big:** Creating stories that are actually epics
2. **Too Vague:** "Improve performance" without specifics
3. **Missing Context:** No description or acceptance criteria
4. **Wrong Type:** Technical tasks marked as stories
5. **No Labels:** Missing critical categorization
6. **Duplicate Work:** Not checking for existing issues
7. **Poor Titles:** Unclear or non-descriptive summaries
8. **Missing Dependencies:** Not linking related issues
9. **Wrong Priority:** Everything marked as critical
10. **No Team Assignment:** Unclear ownership

Remember: Good categorization makes project management easier, enables better reporting, and helps teams work more efficiently. When in doubt, start with a larger scope and break it down as you learn more.
